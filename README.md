# IoT Security
IoT Security | Bachelor Thesis project comprised of 3 different smaller repositories.

The purpose of my project is to provide a web platform meant to manage CVEs of popular device types in order to strengthen users' defence against cyberattacks.

I have developed my bachelor thesis project on the GitLab platform. It is comprised of 3 different smaller projects, each representing an important component of the final product.
